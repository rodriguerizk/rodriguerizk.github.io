It's fascinating how the **human brain** operates like a high-bandwidth, real-time **inference engine** when driving.

You're constantly processing a rich stream of sensory data, e.g., road signs, vehicle dynamics, pedestrian motion, signal states, even subtle cues like weather and lighting. It's a complex, multimodal input space.

And yet, decisions have to be made in milliseconds: when to brake, merge, yield, or take evasive action. It's real-time policy learning in a dynamic environment, with safety-critical consequences.

Humans do this intuitively, but replicating even a fraction of it with machines is the real frontier.
