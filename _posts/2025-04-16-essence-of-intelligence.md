The essence of **intelligence**, whether human or artificial, lies not merely in the accumulation or storage of information, but in the capacity to dynamically integrate context, experience, and memory to generate meaningful and timely responses.

Connecting the dots is what makes knowledge powerful. It’s not about how much we know, but how we use what we know: drawing from experience, making associations in real time, and applying insight at just the right moment. That’s what makes a person witty. That’s what makes an information system intelligent. That’s what turns data into decisions, i.e. **agency**.

As the saying goes, “Wisdom is not having information, but knowing when and how to use it.” Storing knowledge is easy. Using it meaningfully? That’s the real art.
